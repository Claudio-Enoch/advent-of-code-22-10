</div>

## Requirements

- [Python3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/)

## Run

`python main.py`

## Notes

I've completed this problem with an OOP approach.  
My [original attempt](https://github.com/Claudio-Enoch/advent-of-code/blob/main/2021/10.py), 4 months ago, was done in a
more functional style.

## Enhancements

- Tests for main and edge cases
- Logging for better debugging
- Models share code and should instead inherit from an abstract base class
- Allow for caller to pass in the data filepath
